# The Helium Token

The Helium Token is the native cryptocurrency and protocol token of the Helium blockchain. Its symbol is `HNT`. The first HNT was produced on July 29th, 2019 at 09:43PM UTC as part of the genesis block that was mined with the Helium Network launch. Prior to this date, there was no premine of `HNT`.

## Helium Token Usage

The Helium Token is designed to serve the needs of the two primary parties of the Helium blockchain ecosystem: 

1. **Hotspot Hosts and Network Operators**. Host [mine HNT](/docs/blockchain/mining) while deploying and maintaining network coverage.
2. **Enterprises and developers using the Helium Network** to connect devices and build applications. Data Credits, which are derived from HNT in a burn transaction, [are used pay transaction fees](/docs/blockchain/transaction-fees) for the data transmissions on the network (in addition to things like adding Hotspots and sending). 


## HNT Token Economic Concepts

### Halvenings and Max Supply

Since the [genesis block](https://explorer.helium.com/blocks/1), the Network has mined a target of `5,000,000` HNT per month. And since the [community approval of HIP 20](https://github.com/helium/HIP/issues/73), the Helium blockchain uses a two year halving schedule, with a maximum supply of `223,000,000` HNT. 

HNT halving happens every two years from the genesis block, on the following schedule. 

:::info
In the below issuance schedule, year 1 starts on **August 1, 2020**. Therefore the first halving will happen on day one of year three, which is **August 1, 2022**.

:::important
While the above schedule will states approximately `240,000,000` HNT will be produced, year one of the blockchain only produced around `43,000,000` of the target `60,000,000` due to some slow block times. So the actual maximum supply is `223,000,000` HNT.
